        <p>Hi I am Seheb, welcome to My.favorite.com. My favorite hobby is reading! Not the boring reading. The fun adventure one!!! My favorite series of books is "The land of stories", it's a really great book. Spoiler Alert: There are 2 people who travel beetweem dimensions, and guess what? They go to the fairy tale world!!!!!!!!! Yes with cinderella and sleeping beauty and much more! There are many books that's why the fun never ends! I told you I don't read boring books! Ok, now the boring part: I started reading when a pesky virus came and I had to stay at home. I was very bored, then I started reading books! I have read about a million books!!! I read books in my free time and I really enjoy reading them!!!</p>
